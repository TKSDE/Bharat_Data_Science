Launch Jupyter Notebook:
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create and run the notebook. Then, enter the following command:

Copy code
jupyter notebook
This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser.

Create a New Notebook:
In the Jupyter Notebook interface, click the "New" button and select "Python 3" to create a new notebook. You can rename the notebook to something like "Handwritten_Digit_Recognition.ipynb".

Add Markdown Cells:
In the first cell of your notebook, copy and paste the Markdown content I provided earlier. This content will serve as an introduction and overview of your project.

Add Code Cells:
Below the Markdown cell, start adding code cells to implement the functionality. Here's a breakdown of the code you can add:

Import Libraries:
In a code cell, copy and paste the import statements for the required libraries.

Load and Preprocess Data:
Load the MNIST dataset, normalize the pixel values, and convert labels to categorical format.

Build Neural Network Model:
Create a sequential model with appropriate layers for your neural network.

Compile Model:
Compile the model with the chosen optimizer and loss function.

Train Model:
Train the model using the training data, specifying the number of epochs and batch size.

Evaluate Model:
Evaluate the model's accuracy on the test data.

Prediction Example:
Generate predictions for a random test image and print the predicted digit.

Run Code Cells:
Run each code cell by selecting it and clicking the "Run" button or by pressing Shift + Enter. The output of each code cell will be displayed below it.

Review Results:
Review the output of each code cell to ensure there are no errors and that the model training and evaluation proceed as expected.

Save and Share:
After running the code and reviewing the results, you can save the notebook. You can also export it as a PDF, HTML, or other formats to share with others.

Remember to adjust the code as needed and make sure you have the required libraries installed. If any library is missing, you can install it using pip or conda.

Note: Running the training process may take some time depending on your machine's processing power. If you're new to Jupyter Notebook, you might find some online tutorials helpful to get familiar with the interface and execution process.
